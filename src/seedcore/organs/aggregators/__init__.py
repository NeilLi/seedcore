Light Aggregators Package

This package contains lightweight aggregators that efficiently collect state
from distributed Ray actors and memory managers, implementing Paper ยง3.1
requirements for light aggregators.

Components:
- AgentStateAggregator: Collects agent state (h vectors, P matrix, capability, lifecycle)
- MemoryManagerAggregator: Collects memory statistics (ma, mw, mlt, mfb)
- SystemStateAggregator: Collects system state (h_hgnn, E patterns, w_mode)
