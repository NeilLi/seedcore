# Service Dependencies and Restart Behavior

## Overview

This document explains the dependency relationships and restart behavior in the SeedCore distributed system, particularly focusing on the interaction between `seedcore-api`, Ray cluster, and external databases.

## Behavior Observed

* If you stop **all services and start them together** (`./start-cluster.sh`), everything (including `seedcore-api`) works correctly.
* If you try to **restart only `seedcore-api`** (without also restarting Ray Head, databases, etc), it gets stuck or doesn't work correctly.

## Why This Happens

### 1. Ray Client/Cluster State

* `seedcore-api` **connects to the running Ray cluster** (`ray-head`) at startup.
* Ray cluster state (and actors, object store, namespaces, etc) **can become inconsistent or unavailable** if you restart only the API but not Ray.
* **Ray client connections are NOT stateless**: If the head is restarted (or out of sync with workers), new API connections may hang or fail.

### 2. Actor & Namespace Coupling

* If your API relies on **singleton actors, objects, or persistent Ray state**, but those only exist for the life of the Ray cluster, a new API container may wait for them to reappear, re-initialize, or may encounter stale references.

### 3. Service Health Checks and Dependencies

* Docker Compose uses `depends_on`, but **does not wait for a service to be fully "ready"**‚Äîonly for the container to be running.
* If you restart only `seedcore-api`, but `ray-head` is not healthy yet (or the dashboard/serve are not fully up), the API's attempts to connect can hang or fail.
* The logs show the **head node health check is the gating step** for starting the API, which is correct. But if you try to restart only API later, there's no gating on the readiness of Ray Serve, actors, or databases.

### 4. Ray Networking

* Ray is sensitive to **container network** timing: restarting a single service may cause network/cluster state to mismatch (especially if Ray head IPs or node IDs change).

## Dependency Tree for `seedcore-api`

```
seedcore-api
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ> ray-head (Ray cluster, Serve deployment, actor registry)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ> seedcore-mysql / seedcore-postgres / seedcore-neo4j (DBs)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ> application code (models, config)
```

* If any dependency (especially Ray head) is **not available, or in a different state** than at API container startup, API may block, fail to connect, or need to recreate state.

## Best Practices

### Current Setup (Recommended)

* **Start all core services together, in order:** Databases ‚Üí Ray Head ‚Üí API ‚Üí Workers.
* **Only restart API when you're sure Ray Head and all dependencies are fully up** (and cluster state is correct).
* Health checks on Ray head and DBs help, but cannot guarantee Ray's internal state is "ready for clients" if you restart only the API.

### Making API Restarts More Robust

1. **Implement retry/backoff on Ray client connection** in your API, so that it will wait for Ray to become ready, not just fail or hang.
2. **Make your singleton/actor logic in Ray robust to reconnections/restarts**‚Äîe.g., always create or get by name, never assume previous in-memory state.
3. **Optionally, add a `/readyz` endpoint or explicit healthcheck** in Ray Serve (or your API) to report if all dependencies are healthy before declaring "ready."
4. **Document for operators**: "Restarting seedcore-api alone may not work unless the Ray cluster and databases are fully healthy and ready."
5. **If you need zero-downtime API restarts,** consider running Ray in a more persistent or externalized way (not as short-lived containers).

## Quick Diagnostic for Dependency Issues

If API hangs or fails after independent restart, check:

1. Is Ray head up and serving on port 10001?
2. Can you run `ray status` in the head and see correct worker and actor state?
3. Are databases up and healthy?
4. Does API log show successful Ray client initialization and actor access?

## Common Restart Scenarios

### ‚úÖ Recommended: Full Cluster Restart

```bash
# Stop all services
docker compose -p seedcore down

# Start everything together
./start-cluster.sh
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risky: API-Only Restart

```bash
# This may fail if Ray cluster state is inconsistent
docker compose -p seedcore restart seedcore-api
```

### üîß Safe API Restart (When Needed)

```bash
# 1. Ensure Ray head is healthy
docker ps | grep seedcore-ray-head

# 2. Check Ray cluster status
docker exec seedcore-ray-head ray status

# 3. Verify databases are healthy
docker ps | grep -E "(seedcore-postgres|seedcore-mysql|seedcore-neo4j)"

# 4. Then restart API
docker compose -p seedcore restart seedcore-api
```

## Troubleshooting

### API Hangs on Startup

**Symptoms:**
- API container shows "health: starting" for extended periods
- No response from API endpoints
- Empty replies from server

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check if Ray head is healthy
docker ps | grep seedcore-ray-head

# Check Ray cluster status
docker exec seedcore-ray-head ray status

# Check API logs for connection errors
docker logs seedcore-api --tail 20
```

**Solution:**
- Restart the entire cluster: `./start-cluster.sh`
- Or ensure Ray head is healthy before restarting API

### ML Service Not Available

**Symptoms:**
- Salience health endpoint returns `"model_loaded": false`
- Fallback scoring being used
- Circuit breaker not triggered

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check if Ray Serve is deployed
curl -s http://localhost:8265/api/serve/applications/ | jq .

# Test ML endpoint directly
curl http://localhost:8000/ml/score/salience -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"features": [{"task_risk": 0.8, "failure_severity": 0.9}]}'
```

**Solution:**
- Ensure Ray head container is running and healthy
- Check that ML deployment completed successfully
- Verify network connectivity between API and Ray head

## Summary

* **`seedcore-api` depends critically on the Ray head and databases** being available and in the expected state at startup.
* **Independent restarts** of the API **may fail or hang** if dependencies are not fully up or cluster state is inconsistent.
* **The safest way** is to stop/start all core services together, as implemented in `start-cluster.sh`.

This behavior is typical for Ray and other stateful, cluster-coupled services. The architecture is correct‚Äîthe dependency management ensures reliable operation when services are started together in the proper order.
