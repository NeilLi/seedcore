   - Multi-agent system development
   - Energy optimization research
   - Memory system research

2. **Production Systems with Advanced Requirements**
   - Autonomous vehicles
   - Smart city infrastructure
   - Industrial automation
   - Scientific computing

3. **Complex Simulation Environments**

   - Learning system simulations
   - Research simulations

4. **High-Performance Computing**
   - Distributed AI systems
   - Real-time optimization

   - Scientific computing

### When to Stick with `main.py`:

1. **Simple API Services**
   - Basic task management
   - Simple CRUD operations
   - Lightweight microservices
   - API gateways

2. **Resource-Constrained Environments**
   - Edge computing
   - IoT devices
   - Mobile applications
   - Low-power systems

3. **Standard Business Applications**
   - Web applications
   - Standard APIs
   - Simple automation
   - Basic monitoring

## üîß **Migration Path**

If you start with `main.py` and later need advanced features:

1. **Gradual Migration**: Add specific routers to `main.py` as needed
2. **Hybrid Deployment**: Run both services for different use cases
3. **Feature Flags**: Use environment variables to enable/disable features
4. **Service Mesh**: Deploy advanced features as separate microservices

## üìà **Performance Considerations**

- **`main.py`**: ~100 lines, minimal dependencies, fast startup
- **`server.py`**: ~2700 lines, heavy dependencies, complex startup
- **Memory Usage**: `server.py` uses significantly more memory
- **Startup Time**: `server.py` takes longer to initialize
- **Resource Requirements**: `server.py` needs more CPU and memory

## üéØ **Recommendation**

Start with `main.py` for simple use cases and migrate to `server.py` when you need:
- AI-powered features
- Energy management
- Complex multi-agent systems
- Advanced monitoring
- Research capabilities

The consolidation we did allows you to easily switch between the two based on your specific requirements.
