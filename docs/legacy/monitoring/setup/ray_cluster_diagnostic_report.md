## üé≠ Active Agents & Actors

### Singleton Actors (Core System)
‚úÖ **MissTracker** - `ClientActorHandle(761e2d510a476da8a67dba3b01000000)`
- **Status:** Running
- **Purpose:** Tracks cache misses and performance metrics
- **Current Data:** 0 top misses recorded
- **Process ID:** 575

‚úÖ **SharedCache** - `ClientActorHandle(6b44e29a404f1533c693f31001000000)`
- **Status:** Running  
- **Purpose:** Distributed shared cache for data storage
- **Current Data:** 0 cache items
- **Process ID:** 575

‚úÖ **MwStore** - `ClientActorHandle(18153555b699205a2aca7a1b01000000)`
- **Status:** Running
- **Purpose:** Working memory store for agent data
- **Process ID:** 623

### Ray Agent Processes
‚úÖ **RayAgent** - Multiple instances running
- **Process IDs:** 7345, 7400
- **Status:** Active and processing
- **Purpose:** Ray's internal agent management

### Dashboard Services
‚úÖ **Ray Dashboard Components** - All running
- MetricsHead (PID: 109)
- DataHead (PID: 110) 
- EventHead (PID: 111)
- JobHead (PID: 112)
- NodeHead (PID: 113)
- ReportHead (PID: 114)
- ServeHead (PID: 115)
- StateHead (PID: 116)
- TrainHead (PID: 117)

## üîç Agent Analysis

### What They're Doing
1. **MissTracker**: Monitoring cache performance and tracking miss patterns
2. **SharedCache**: Providing distributed caching layer for data storage
3. **MwStore**: Managing working memory for agent operations
4. **RayAgent**: Handling Ray's internal cluster management and task distribution

### Who Started Them
- **System Actors**: Automatically started by Ray cluster initialization
- **Application Actors**: Started by the seedcore application framework
- **Dashboard Services**: Started by Ray's dashboard system

### Current Activity Level
- **CPU Usage**: 0.0/4.0 cores (0% utilization)
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (0B of 20.61 GiB)
- **Object Store**: Very low usage (26.68 KiB of 8.83 GiB)

## üö® Missing Components

### ObserverAgent
‚ùå **Status:** Not currently running
- **Expected Location:** Named actor in 'seedcore' namespace
- **How to Start:** Run `python -m scripts.scenario_3_proactive_caching`
- **Purpose:** Monitors system behavior and triggers proactive actions

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Cluster Health
- ‚úÖ All 4 nodes are alive and responsive
- ‚úÖ No pending nodes or recent failures
- ‚úÖ Dashboard is accessible and functional
- ‚úÖ All core services are running

### Resource Efficiency
- **CPU Utilization:** 0% (idle state)
- **Memory Utilization:** 0% (minimal usage)
- **Object Store Utilization:** 0.0003% (very low)

## üîß Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Start ObserverAgent** if monitoring is needed:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it ray-head python3 -m scripts.scenario_3_proactive_caching
   ```

2. **Monitor Real-time Activity**:
   ```bash
   docker logs -f ray-head
   ```

3. **Access Dashboard** for visual monitoring:
   - URL: http://localhost:8265
   - Provides real-time cluster metrics and actor status

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Resource Utilization**: Cluster is currently idle - consider running workloads
2. **Actor Management**: Core actors are healthy but could benefit from ObserverAgent
3. **Monitoring**: Enable ObserverAgent for proactive system monitoring

## üìà Historical Context

### Cluster Uptime
- **Started:** 2025-07-29 19:13:42
- **Current Runtime:** ~42 minutes
- **Restart History:** Cluster was restarted once (previous instance at 04:39:48)

### Recent Activity
- Cluster has been stable since restart
- All core actors successfully initialized
- No error conditions detected

## üéØ Summary

The Ray cluster is **healthy and operational** with:
- ‚úÖ 4 active nodes (1 head + 3 workers)
- ‚úÖ All core system actors running
- ‚úÖ Dashboard accessible
- ‚úÖ No resource constraints or failures
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ObserverAgent not currently active (optional component)

The cluster is ready for workloads and all core infrastructure is functioning correctly.
