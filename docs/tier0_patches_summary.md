# Tier0MemoryManager Hardening Patches

This document summarizes the hardening patches applied to the Tier0MemoryManager to improve reliability, performance, and robustness.

## Patches Implemented

### 1. Hardened Ray Connect with Exponential Backoff

**Problem**: Ray connection failures could cause immediate failures without retry logic.

**Solution**: Enhanced `_ensure_ray()` method with:
- Exponential backoff (0.5s, 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
- Up to 6 connection attempts
- Proper namespace fallback: `SEEDCORE_NS` → `RAY_NAMESPACE` → `"seedcore-dev"`
- Support for `RAY_ADDRESS` environment variable
- Uses `ensure_ray_initialized` from `ray_utils`

**Benefits**:
- Resilient to temporary network issues
- Better error reporting with attempt counts
- Consistent namespace resolution

### 2. Idempotent Named Actors

**Problem**: Creating agents could fail if named actors already existed, causing duplicate creation attempts.

**Solution**: Enhanced `create_agent()` method to:
- Check for existing named actors before creation
- Reuse existing actors when found
- Attach existing actors to the manager registry
- Only create new actors when none exist

**Benefits**:
- Prevents duplicate actor creation
- Supports AI Factory and other pre-created actors
- Maintains stable actor names across restarts

### 3. Non-Blocking Telemetry Collection

**Problem**: `ray.get()` calls in telemetry collection could block the event loop, causing poor responsiveness.

**Solution**: Implemented non-blocking telemetry with:
- Thread pool executor for `ray.get()` calls
- Configurable timeouts via environment variables
- Exception handling per agent (failures don't block others)
- Success/failure reporting

**Environment Variables**:
- `TIER0_TP_MAX`: Thread pool max workers (default: 8)
- `TIER0_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT`: Heartbeat timeout (default: 2.0s)
- `TIER0_STATS_TIMEOUT`: Stats timeout (default: 2.5s)

**Benefits**:
- Event loop remains responsive
- Individual agent failures don't block collection
- Configurable timeouts prevent hanging
- Better error isolation

### 4. Faster Liveness Check

**Problem**: `ray.get()` for liveness checks could be slow and block other operations.

**Solution**: Enhanced `_alive()` method using:
- `ray.wait()` instead of `ray.get()`
- Early return when ready
- Same 2-second timeout

**Benefits**:
- Faster liveness detection
- Non-blocking when agents are responsive
- Better performance for large agent counts

## Code Changes Summary

### New Imports
```python
import concurrent.futures
```

### New Module-Level Components
```python
# Non-blocking ray.get helper
_EXECUTOR = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(
    max_workers=int(os.getenv("TIER0_TP_MAX", "8"))
)

async def _aget(obj_ref, timeout: float = 2.0):
    """Non-blocking ray.get with timeout using thread pool."""
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    return await loop.run_in_executor(_EXECUTOR, lambda: ray.get(obj_ref, timeout=timeout))
```

### Enhanced Methods

1. **`_ensure_ray()`**: Added exponential backoff and better error handling
2. **`create_agent()`**: Made idempotent with existing actor reuse
3. **`collect_heartbeats()`**: Non-blocking with timeouts and error isolation
4. **`collect_agent_stats()`**: Non-blocking with timeouts and error isolation
5. **`_alive()`**: Faster using `ray.wait()`

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TIER0_TP_MAX` | 8 | Thread pool max workers for non-blocking calls |
| `TIER0_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT` | 2.0 | Heartbeat collection timeout (seconds) |
| `TIER0_STATS_TIMEOUT` | 2.5 | Stats collection timeout (seconds) |
| `SEEDCORE_NS` | - | Preferred Ray namespace |
| `RAY_NAMESPACE` | - | Fallback Ray namespace |
| `RAY_ADDRESS` | - | Ray cluster address |
| `RAY_HOST` | seedcore-svc-head-svc | Ray host (when RAY_ADDRESS not set) |
| `RAY_PORT` | 10001 | Ray port (when RAY_ADDRESS not set) |

## Testing

The patches have been tested for:
- ✅ Python syntax validity
- ✅ Import compatibility
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Backward compatibility

## Migration Notes

These patches are **backward compatible** and require no changes to existing code. The enhancements are:

1. **Automatic**: Exponential backoff and idempotent creation work transparently
2. **Configurable**: Timeouts and thread pool size can be tuned via environment variables
3. **Non-breaking**: All existing APIs remain unchanged

## Performance Impact

- **Positive**: Non-blocking telemetry improves event loop responsiveness
- **Positive**: Faster liveness checks reduce latency
- **Positive**: Idempotent creation prevents duplicate work
- **Neutral**: Exponential backoff only affects connection failures (rare)

## Reliability Improvements

1. **Network Resilience**: Exponential backoff handles temporary connectivity issues
2. **Actor Management**: Idempotent creation prevents conflicts with pre-existing actors
3. **Error Isolation**: Individual agent failures don't block system-wide operations
4. **Timeout Protection**: Configurable timeouts prevent hanging operations

These patches significantly improve the robustness and performance of the Tier0MemoryManager while maintaining full backward compatibility.
