# Docker and Docs Reorganization Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the reorganization of the `docker/` and `docs/` folders to improve efficiency and maintainability for future development stages.

## Current Issues

### Docker Folder Issues:
- Mixed concerns: Dockerfiles, scripts, tests, configs, and artifacts in one location
- No clear separation between development, testing, and production resources
- Artifacts (data files) mixed with code and configuration
- Inconsistent file organization

### Docs Folder Issues:
- Version-specific fix documents mixed with general documentation
- No clear hierarchy for different types of documentation
- Historical documents cluttering current reference material
- Inconsistent naming conventions

## Proposed New Structure

### Docker Folder Reorganization:
```

├── build/                    # Docker build resources
│   ├── Dockerfiles/         # All Dockerfile variants

└── README.md                # Docker-specific documentation
```

```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Create New Structure
1. Create new directory structure
2. Move files to appropriate locations
3. Update internal references

### Phase 2: Clean Up
1. Remove duplicate files
2. Consolidate similar documents
3. Update documentation links

### Phase 3: Validation
1. Verify all links work
2. Test build and deployment processes
3. Update CI/CD pipelines if needed

## Benefits

### Improved Efficiency:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to find relevant files
- Reduced cognitive load for developers
- Better scalability for future growth

### Better Maintainability:
- Logical grouping of related files
- Easier to update and maintain
- Clear ownership of different areas
- Reduced duplication

### Enhanced Developer Experience:
- Intuitive file organization
- Faster onboarding for new developers
- Clear documentation hierarchy
- Better tooling support

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1**: Create new structure and move files
- **Week 2**: Update references and test functionality
- **Week 3**: Clean up and finalize
- **Week 4**: Documentation and team training

## Success Metrics

- Reduced time to find relevant files
- Fewer questions about file locations
- Improved build and deployment times
- Better documentation coverage
