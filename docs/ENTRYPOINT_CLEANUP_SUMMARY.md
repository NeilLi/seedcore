# Entrypoint Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup of deprecated entrypoint files following the implementation of the unified ops application that merges EventizerService, FactManager, StateService, and EnergyService into a single Ray Serve application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Unified Ops Application Implementation ✅

**New File:** `entrypoints/ops_entrypoint.py`
- **Purpose:** Unified Ray Serve application hosting all ops services
- **Services Included:**
  - EventizerService: Text processing and classification
  - FactManager: Policy-driven fact management with PKG integration
  - StateService: Centralized state aggregation
  - EnergyService: Energy calculations and optimization
- **Route Prefix:** `/ops`
- **Architecture:** Single gateway with internal service handles

### 2. Updated RayService Configuration ✅

**File:** `deploy/rayservice.yaml`
- **Removed:** Separate `state` and `energy` applications
- **Added:** Unified `ops` application with 5 deployments:
  - `OpsGateway`: HTTP ingress (0.1 CPU)
  - `EventizerService`: Text processing (0.4 CPU, 1GB RAM)
  - `FactManager`: Fact management (0.3 CPU, 1GB RAM)
  - `StateService`: State aggregation (0.2 CPU, 1GB RAM)
  - `EnergyService`: Energy calculations (0.2 CPU, 1GB RAM)

### 3. Deprecated Entrypoint Files ⚠️

#### `entrypoints/state_entrypoint.py`
- **Status:** DEPRECATED
- **Changes:**
  - Added deprecation warnings in docstring
  - Added deprecation warnings in `build_state_app()` function
  - Updated `main()` function to warn users about deprecation
  - Changed route prefix to `/state-deprecated`
  - Changed service name to `state-service-deprecated`

#### `entrypoints/energy_entrypoint.py`
- **Status:** DEPRECATED
- **Changes:**
  - Added deprecation warnings in docstring
  - Added deprecation warnings in `build_energy_app()` function
  - Updated `main()` function to warn users about deprecation
  - Changed route prefix to `/energy-deprecated`
  - Changed service name to `energy-service-deprecated`

#### `entrypoints/serve_entrypoint.py`
- **Status:** DEPRECATED (XGBoost service)
- **Changes:**
  - Added deprecation warnings in docstring
  - Updated `main()` function to exit with error and deprecation message
  - XGBoost functionality fully covered by ML service at `/ml/xgboost/*`
  - Marked as redundant and deprecated

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Clients

**Before (Separate Applications):**
```bash
# State service
curl http://localhost:8000/state/get/unified

# Energy service  
curl http://localhost:8000/energy/summary

# XGBoost service (legacy)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/xgb \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"features": [[1,2,3,4]]}'
```

**After (Unified Applications):**
```bash
# State service (now under /ops)
curl http://localhost:8000/ops/state

# Energy service (now under /ops)
curl http://localhost:8000/ops/energy/summary

# XGBoost service (now under /ml with enhanced features)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ml/xgboost/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"features": [[1,2,3,4]]}'

# New services available
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ops/eventizer/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Emergency alert: Fire detected"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ops/facts/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Room 101 temperature is 72°F"}'
```

### For RayService YAML Configuration

**Before:**
```yaml
applications:
  - name: state
    import_path: entrypoints.state_entrypoint:build_state_app
    route_prefix: /state
  - name: energy
    import_path: entrypoints.energy_entrypoint:build_energy_app
    route_prefix: /energy
```

**After:**
```yaml
applications:
  - name: ops
    import_path: entrypoints.ops_entrypoint:build_ops_app
    route_prefix: /ops
    deployments:
      - name: OpsGateway
      - name: EventizerService
      - name: FactManager
      - name: StateService
      - name: EnergyService
```

## Benefits of Unified Application

### 1. **Simplified Operations**
- **Single HTTP Entrypoint:** `/ops` instead of multiple `/state`, `/energy` routes
- **Unified Management:** One application to deploy, monitor, and scale
- **Reduced Complexity:** Fewer Ray Serve applications to manage

### 2. **Better Resource Utilization**
- **Shared Gateway:** Single ingress point reduces HTTP proxy overhead
- **In-Cluster Communication:** Services communicate via Ray handles (faster than HTTP)
- **Independent Scaling:** Each service can scale independently within the same app

### 3. **Enhanced Features**
- **Cross-Service Integration:** Services can easily collaborate
- **Unified Health Checks:** Single endpoint for overall application health
- **Consistent Error Handling:** Standardized error responses across all services

### 4. **Future-Proof Architecture**
- **Easy Extension:** New services can be added to the ops application
- **PKG Integration:** All services can share PKG governance policies
- **Centralized Configuration:** Single configuration point for all ops services

## Testing

### Automated Test Script
**File:** `scripts/test_ops_integration.sh`
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive testing of all ops application endpoints
- **Coverage:** All four services with various test scenarios
- **Usage:** `./scripts/test_ops_integration.sh [BASE_URL]`

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Overall health check (`/ops/health`)
- ✅ Eventizer text processing (`/ops/eventizer/process`)
- ✅ Facts creation and querying (`/ops/facts/*`)
- ✅ State retrieval (`/ops/state/*`)
- ✅ Energy metrics and summary (`/ops/energy/*`)
- ✅ Individual service health checks

## Rollback Plan

If rollback is needed:

1. **Revert RayService YAML:**
   ```yaml
   # Remove ops application and restore separate applications
   - name: state
     import_path: entrypoints.state_entrypoint:build_state_app
     route_prefix: /state
   - name: energy
     import_path: entrypoints.energy_entrypoint:build_energy_app
     route_prefix: /energy
   ```

2. **Update Client Code:**
   - Change `/ops/state/*` back to `/state/*`
   - Change `/ops/energy/*` back to `/energy/*`

3. **Remove Deprecation Warnings:**
   - Revert changes to `state_entrypoint.py` and `energy_entrypoint.py`

## Next Steps

### 1. **Monitor Deployment**
- Deploy the unified ops application
- Monitor performance and resource usage
- Verify all endpoints are working correctly

### 2. **Update Documentation**
- Update API documentation with new `/ops/*` endpoints
- Update client integration guides
- Update monitoring and alerting configurations

### 3. **Client Migration**
- Update existing clients to use new `/ops/*` endpoints
- Test client applications with unified application
- Remove references to deprecated endpoints

### 4. **Cleanup (Future)**
- After successful migration, consider removing deprecated entrypoint files
- Archive or remove `state_entrypoint.py` and `energy_entrypoint.py`
- Evaluate if `serve_entrypoint.py` (XGBoost) is still needed

## Summary

The entrypoint cleanup successfully consolidates four separate services into a unified ops application, providing:

- **Simplified Operations:** Single application instead of multiple
- **Better Performance:** In-cluster communication via Ray handles
- **Enhanced Features:** Cross-service integration and unified governance
- **Future-Proof:** Easy to extend with new services

The deprecated entrypoint files are marked with warnings but kept for backward compatibility, allowing for a gradual migration process.
