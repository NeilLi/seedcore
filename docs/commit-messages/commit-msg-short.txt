fix(monitoring): resolve Ray dashboard panel integration issues

- Import Ray's auto-generated dashboard with correct UID (rayDefaultDashboard)
- Configure CORS-enabled proxies for proper metrics access
- Enable anonymous access for Ray dashboard integration
- Update documentation with comprehensive Ray integration guide

Resolves "Panel with id 41 not found" and "Panel with id 24 not found" errors
by using Ray's generated dashboard instead of custom ones with wrong UIDs.
