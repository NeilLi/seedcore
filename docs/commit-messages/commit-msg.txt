fix: eliminate Docker Compose PYTHONPATH warnings and improve ops configuration

## Summary
Fixed Docker Compose PYTHONPATH warnings by replacing variable substitution with direct environment variable assignment. This ensures clean builds and follows Docker Compose best practices.

## Changes Made

### Docker Compose Configuration
- **Fixed PYTHONPATH warnings**: Replaced `- PYTHONPATH=/app:/app/src:${PYTHONPATH}` with `PYTHONPATH: /app:/app/src`
- **Improved YAML format**: Converted from array format to map format for all environment variables
- **Applied to all services**: seedcore-api, db-seed, ray-head, ray-worker
- **Commented version field**: Added explanation for deprecated version field

### Dockerfile Improvements
- **Added PYTHONPATH to Dockerfile.ray**: Set `ENV PYTHONPATH=/app:/app/src` for Ray containers
- **Updated main Dockerfile**: Enhanced PYTHONPATH configuration for consistency

### Runtime Context Guards
- **Fixed duplicate bootstrap calls**: Added runtime context guards in bootstrap.py to prevent worker process bootstrapping
- **Improved Ray actor initialization**: Only driver process creates singleton actors

### Energy System Enhancements
- **Enhanced energy event emission**: Added comprehensive energy events in RayAgent.execute_task()
- **Improved energy ledger updates**: Real-time event-driven energy tracking
- **Added health check endpoint**: `/healthz/energy` for energy system monitoring
- **Created energy calibration test**: `scripts/test_energy_calibration.py` for weight optimization

### Documentation Updates
- **Updated ENERGY_MODEL_FOUNDATION.md**: Added troubleshooting section for Docker Compose warnings
- **Enhanced RAY_DASHBOARD_FIXES.md**: Added environment variable fixes and best practices
- **Updated README.md**: Added note about optimized Docker Compose configuration

## Technical Details

### Root Cause Analysis
The PYTHONPATH warning occurred because Docker Compose tried to expand `${PYTHONPATH}` at build time when the variable wasn't set on the host. This is a common issue with variable substitution in Docker Compose.

### Solution Approach
1. **Direct Assignment**: Use `PYTHONPATH: /app:/app/src` instead of variable substitution
2. **Consistent Format**: Apply map format to all environment variables
3. **Deterministic Builds**: Ensure same behavior regardless of host environment

### Benefits
- ✅ **Clean Builds**: No more PYTHONPATH warnings during docker compose operations
- ✅ **Deterministic**: Consistent behavior across different host environments
- ✅ **Best Practice**: Follows Docker Compose recommended patterns
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Clear, explicit configuration without hidden dependencies

## Testing
- ✅ `docker compose config --quiet` - No warnings
- ✅ `docker compose build --no-cache seedcore-api` - Clean build
- ✅ All services start without environment variable issues
- ✅ Ray dashboard and energy system functioning correctly

## Files Modified
- `docker/docker-compose.yml` - Fixed environment variable format
- `docker/Dockerfile` - Enhanced PYTHONPATH configuration
- `docker/Dockerfile.ray` - Added PYTHONPATH environment variable
- `src/seedcore/bootstrap.py` - Added runtime context guards
- `src/seedcore/agents/ray_actor.py` - Enhanced energy event emission
- `src/seedcore/telemetry/server.py` - Added energy health check endpoint
- `scripts/test_energy_calibration.py` - New energy calibration test
- `docs/ENERGY_MODEL_FOUNDATION.md` - Updated troubleshooting section
- `docker/RAY_DASHBOARD_FIXES.md` - Added environment variable fixes
- `README.md` - Added quick start improvements

## Related Issues
- Fixes Docker Compose PYTHONPATH warnings
- Improves Ray actor bootstrap efficiency
- Enhances energy system monitoring and calibration
- Provides better operational visibility and debugging

## Breaking Changes
None - this is a backward-compatible improvement that only affects build-time warnings and operational efficiency.
