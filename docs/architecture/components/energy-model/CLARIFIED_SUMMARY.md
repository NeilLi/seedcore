# Clarified Energy System Summary & Implementation Status

## Executive Summary

This document provides a clarified summary of the SeedCore energy system analysis, comparing the current implementation against the validation blueprint and outlining the concrete steps needed to achieve the "more precise & truly useful" energy model.

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ What's Now Working (Updated)

1. **Energy Ledger Foundation**: ‚úÖ Enhanced with history tracking and adaptive weights
2. **Basic Energy Calculation**: ‚úÖ All five terms implemented with proper mathematical formulations
3. **Control Loop Structure**: ‚úÖ Fast loop (200ms) and slow loop (2s) frameworks exist
4. **Telemetry Infrastructure**: ‚úÖ Prometheus metrics are set up for energy monitoring
5. **Organism Architecture**: ‚úÖ COA organ-based structure is properly implemented
6. **Real-time Telemetry**: ‚úÖ `/energy/gradient` endpoint implemented with slopes and history
7. **Experimental Framework**: ‚úÖ Enhanced harness for synthetic workloads A-D
8. **Adaptive Control**: ‚úÖ Hourly flywheel for global weight adaptation

### ‚ùå Critical Gaps Still Present

#### 1. Regularization Dominance (164% of positive energy)
- **Current**: Œª_reg = 0.01 in config, but embeddings are still bloating the objective
- **Required**: Dynamic Œª_reg adjustment via PSO loop (implemented but needs tuning)
- **Impact**: System is over-regularized, masking true performance

#### 2. Hyper-Edge Term Wiring via HGNN Shim
- **Now**: HGNN pattern shim collects escalations and exposes bounded `E_patterns`; energy calculator accepts `E_sel` with weights `W_hyper` in unified API.
- **Next**: Expand beyond shim by learning `W_hyper` from E-pattern statistics; validate multi-organ coordination.

#### 3. Static Capability & Memory-Utility
- **Current**: Hard-coded capability values, no EWMA updates
- **Required**: Dynamic ci & ui updates driving pair weight scaling
- **Impact**: Pair weights never adapt to performance

#### 4. Memory System Integration
- **Current**: Memory energy is essentially noise (+0.0075)
- **Required**: CostVQ integration and compression/staleness tracking
- **Impact**: No validation of memory efficiency
