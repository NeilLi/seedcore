## Technical Architecture

### Core Components Implemented

#### 1. Ray Cluster Infrastructure
```
Ray Head Node (ray-head)
├── Dashboard (Port 8265)
├── Redis (Port 6379)
├── Job Distribution
└── Resource Management

Ray Workers (3 instances)
├── Distributed Task Execution
├── Agent Computations
└── Workload Distribution
```

#### 2. Cognitive Organism Architecture (COA)
```
OrganismManager (Central Coordinator)
├── Cognitive Organ (cognitive_organ_1)
│   └── 1 Cognitive Agent (reasoning, planning)
├── Actuator Organ (actuator_organ_1)
│   └── 1 Actuator Agent (action execution)
└── Utility Organ (utility_organ_1)
    └── 1 Utility Agent (system management)
```

#### 3. FastAPI Application Server
```
FastAPI Server (seedcore-api)
├── HTTP Endpoints (Port 8000)
├── OrganismManager Integration
├── Task Execution Coordination
└── Health Monitoring
```

### Key Technical Decisions

#### 1. Ray Actor Persistence
- **Decision**: Use `lifetime="detached"` for organ actors
- **Rationale**: Maintain organ state across container restarts
- **Implementation**: OrganismManager handles existing actor retrieval

#### 2. Agent Distribution Strategy
- **Decision**: 1 agent per organ (3 total agents)
- **Rationale**: Simplified management, clear specialization
- **Implementation**: Configuration-driven agent creation

#### 3. Container-Based Diagnostics
- **Decision**: Execute all Ray diagnostics within containers
- **Rationale**: Consistent environment, proper Ray access
- **Implementation**: Script copying and container execution

   - Purpose: FastAPI server
   - Status: RUNNING (expected)

3. **COA Initialization Jobs** (Job 2e000000)

└── OrganismManager (COA Lifecycle Management)
```

## Diagnostic Tools Created

### 1. Ray Cluster Diagnostics
- **monitor_actors.py**: Lists active Ray actors
- **check_ray_version.py**: Verifies Ray and Python versions
- **comprehensive_job_analysis.py**: Detailed cluster analysis

### 2. COA Testing Tools
- **test_organism.py**: Tests COA functionality and API endpoints
- **cleanup_organs.py**: Cleans up detached Ray actors

### 3. Job Analysis Tools
- **job_detailed_analysis.py**: Detailed job scheduling and management analysis

## API Endpoints Implemented

### Organism Management
```bash
GET /organism/status          # Get organism status
POST /organism/execute/{organ_id}  # Execute task on specific organ
POST /organism/execute/random      # Execute task on random organ
GET /organism/summary         # Get organism summary
POST /organism/initialize     # Initialize organism
POST /organism/shutdown       # Shutdown organism
```

### System Health
```bash
GET /health                   # Health check
GET /ray/status              # Ray cluster status
GET /metrics                 # System metrics
```

## Troubleshooting Procedures

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Ray State API Limitations
- **Issue**: Older Ray versions don't support all state API methods
- **Solution**: Use alternative methods (`ray.cluster_resources()`, `ray.nodes()`)

#### 2. Container Access Issues
- **Issue**: Scripts need to run inside containers for Ray access
- **Solution**: Copy scripts to containers and execute with `docker exec`

#### 3. Organ/Agent Persistence
- **Issue**: Detached actors persist across restarts
- **Solution**: OrganismManager checks for existing actors before creating new ones

#### 4. Configuration Errors
- **Issue**: YAML indentation and syntax errors
- **Solution**: Proper YAML validation and file recreation

### Diagnostic Procedures

#### Quick Health Check
```bash
# Check container status
docker compose ps

# Check Ray dashboard
curl http://localhost:8265/#/jobs

# Check COA status
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/organism/status"
```

#### Comprehensive Analysis
```bash
# Run detailed analysis
docker cp comprehensive_job_analysis.py seedcore-api:/tmp/
docker exec -it seedcore-api python3 /tmp/comprehensive_job_analysis.py
```
