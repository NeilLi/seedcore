# Cognitive Core v2 Integration with OCPS Architecture

This document describes how the enhanced Cognitive Core v2 integrates with the OCPS-enabled SeedCore v2 architecture, implementing all the improvements suggested in the DSPy + facts review.

## Overview

The Cognitive Core v2 (now integrated into `cognitive_core.py`) represents a complete evolution of the cognitive reasoning system with the following key enhancements:

- **Enhanced Fact Schema** with provenance, trust, and policy flags
- **RRF Fusion + MMR Diversity** for better retrieval quality
- **Dynamic Token Budgeting** based on OCPS signals and energy state
- **Hardened Cache Governance** with TTL per task type
- **Post-Condition Checks** for DSPy output validation
- **OCPS Integration** for fast/deep path routing decisions
- **Fact Sanitization** and conflict detection

## Integration Points with v2 Architecture

### 1. OCPS Valve Integration

The enhanced cognitive core integrates directly with the OCPS valve for intelligent routing:

```python
def _should_escalate_to_deep_path(self, sufficiency: RetrievalSufficiency, task_type: CognitiveTaskType) -> bool:
    """Determine if task should be escalated to deep path based on retrieval sufficiency."""
    # Escalation criteria based on retrieval quality
    low_coverage = sufficiency.coverage < 0.6
    low_diversity = sufficiency.diversity < 0.5
    high_conflict = sufficiency.conflict_count > 2
    high_staleness = sufficiency.staleness_ratio > 0.3
    low_trust = sufficiency.trust_score < 0.4
    
    # Complex tasks more likely to escalate
    complex_tasks = {CognitiveTaskType.TASK_PLANNING, CognitiveTaskType.PROBLEM_SOLVING, CognitiveTaskType.MEMORY_SYNTHESIS}
    is_complex = task_type in complex_tasks
    
    # Escalate if multiple conditions met
    escalation_score = sum([low_coverage, low_diversity, high_conflict, high_staleness, low_trust])
    should_escalate = (escalation_score >= 2) or (is_complex and escalation_score >= 1)
    
    return should_escalate
```

### 2. Memory Fabric Integration

The cognitive core implements the hardened memory fabric with Tier 2.5 compression:

```python
# Cache governance with TTL per task type
self.cache_ttl_by_task = {
    CognitiveTaskType.FAILURE_ANALYSIS: 300,  # 5 minutes
    CognitiveTaskType.TASK_PLANNING: 1800,    # 30 minutes
    CognitiveTaskType.DECISION_MAKING: 600,   # 10 minutes
    CognitiveTaskType.PROBLEM_SOLVING: 1200,  # 20 minutes
    CognitiveTaskType.MEMORY_SYNTHESIS: 3600, # 1 hour
    CognitiveTaskType.CAPABILITY_ASSESSMENT: 1800, # 30 minutes
}

# Hardened cache keys with provider, model, and schema version
def _generate_cache_key(self, task_type: CognitiveTaskType, agent_id: str, input_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    stable_hash = self._stable_hash(task_type, agent_id, input_data)
    return f"cc:res:{task_type.value}:{self.model}:{self.llm_provider}:{self.schema_version}:{stable_hash}"
```

### 3. Energy Service Integration

Dynamic token budgeting responds to energy state:

```python
def _update_dynamic_budget(self, task_type: Optional[CognitiveTaskType] = None):
    """Update token budget based on OCPS signals and energy state."""
    base_budget = self.base_token_budget
    
    # Adjust based on energy state (if available)
    if self.energy_client:
        try:
            energy_state = self.energy_client.get_current_energy()
            # Reduce budget when energy is low
            if energy_state.get("total_energy", 1.0) < 0.5:
                base_budget *= 0.8
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"Failed to get energy state: {e}")
    
    # Adjust based on OCPS load (if available)
    if self.ocps_client:
        try:
            ocps_status = self.ocps_client.get_status()
            # Reduce budget when system is under high load
            if ocps_status.get("current_load", 0.5) > 0.8:
                base_budget *= 0.7
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"Failed to get OCPS status: {e}")
    
    self.token_budget = max(500, int(base_budget))  # Minimum 500 tokens
```

### 4. State Service Integration

Retrieval sufficiency metrics are sent to the StateService for system-wide analysis:

```python
@dataclass
class RetrievalSufficiency:
    """Retrieval sufficiency metrics for OCPS integration."""
    coverage: float  # How well the facts cover the query
    diversity: float  # How diverse the retrieved facts are
    agreement: float  # How much the facts agree with each other
    token_budget: int  # Available token budget
    token_est: int  # Estimated tokens for retrieved facts
    conflict_count: int  # Number of conflicting facts
    staleness_ratio: float  # Ratio of stale facts
    trust_score: float  # Average trust score of facts
```

## Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Fact Schema

```python
@dataclass
class Fact:
    """Enhanced fact schema with provenance, trust, and policy flags."""
    id: str
    text: str
    score: float
    source: str
    source_uri: Optional[str] = None
    timestamp: Optional[float] = None
    trust: float = 0.5
    signature: Optional[str] = None
    staleness_s: Optional[float] = None
    instructions_present: bool = False
    sanitized_text: Optional[str] = None
    conflict_set: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    
    def _sanitize_text(self, text: str) -> str:
        """Sanitize text by removing code blocks, URLs, mentions, and executable content."""
        # Remove code blocks, URLs, mentions, executable patterns
        # Collapse whitespace and check for instruction patterns
        return sanitized_text
```

### 2. RRF Fusion + MMR Diversity

```python
def _rrf_fuse(self, text_facts: List[Fact], vec_facts: List[Fact]) -> List[Fact]:
    """Reciprocal Rank Fusion with source reliability weighting."""
    # Source reliability weights
    text_weight = 0.6  # Text search is more reliable
    vec_weight = 0.4   # Vector search for semantic similarity
    
    # RRF: 1 / (rank + k), where k=60 is typical
    for i, fact in enumerate(text_facts):
        rrf_score = text_weight / (i + 60)
        all_facts[fact.id].score += rrf_score
    
    return sorted(all_facts.values(), key=lambda x: x.score, reverse=True)

def _mmr_diversify(self, facts: List[Fact], query: str, k: int) -> List[Fact]:
    """Maximal Marginal Relevance diversification to avoid near-duplicates."""
    # MMR score = λ * relevance - (1-λ) * max_similarity
    # Select facts that are both relevant and diverse
```

### 3. Post-Condition Checks

```python
def _check_post_conditions(self, result: Dict[str, Any], task_type: CognitiveTaskType) -> Tuple[bool, List[str]]:
    """Check post-conditions for DSPy outputs to ensure policy compliance."""
    violations = []
    
    # Check confidence score bounds
    # Check for PII patterns
    # Check for executable content
    # Check numeric ranges for specific fields
    
    return len(violations) == 0, violations
```

### 4. Enhanced DSPy Signatures

All signatures now use `WithKnowledgeMixin` for consistent knowledge context:

```python
class AnalyzeFailureSignature(WithKnowledgeMixin, dspy.Signature):
    """Analyze agent failures and propose solutions with historical context."""
    incident_context = dspy.InputField(...)
    thought = dspy.OutputField(desc="...considering the knowledge context.")
    proposed_solution = dspy.OutputField(desc="...based on historical facts.")
    confidence_score = dspy.OutputField(...)
    risk_factors = dspy.OutputField(desc="...from the knowledge context.")
```

### Alerting Rules
```yaml
- alert: RetrievalSufficiencyLow
  expr: coverage < 0.6 or diversity < 0.5
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "Retrieval sufficiency below threshold"

- alert: PostConditionViolations
  expr: post_condition_violations > 0
  for: 1m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "DSPy output policy violations detected"
```

## Migration Path

### From v1 to v2
1. **Enhanced** `cognitive_core.py` with v2 capabilities
2. **Maintained** backward compatibility with existing imports
3. **Added** OCPS and Energy client integration points
4. **Deployed** with enhanced Serve configuration
5. **Monitoring** retrieval sufficiency and escalation rates

### Backward Compatibility
- **API**: Maintains same `forward()` method signature
- **Context**: `CognitiveContext` remains unchanged
- **Results**: Enhanced metadata but compatible format
- **Caching**: Graceful degradation if MW unavailable

## Conclusion

The Cognitive Core v2 represents a complete evolution of the cognitive reasoning system, implementing all the suggested improvements while maintaining full integration with the OCPS-enabled v2 architecture. The system now provides:

- **Better Retrieval**: RRF fusion + MMR diversity for higher quality facts
- **Intelligent Routing**: OCPS integration for optimal fast/deep path decisions
- **Dynamic Resource Management**: Token budgeting based on system state
