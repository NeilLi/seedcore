feat: organize project structure and clean up root directory

- Move documentation files to docs/ folder
- Organize commit messages in docs/commit-messages/
- Move utility scripts to scripts/ folder
- Remove docs-bak/ after confirming docs/ has latest content
- Create FILE_ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md for tracking changes

Improves project maintainability and discoverability by grouping
related files in logical directories while keeping root clean.
