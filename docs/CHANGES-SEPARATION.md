# Changes Made for Service Separation

This document summarizes all the changes made to separate the serve modules from the main `seedcore-api` service.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/seedcore/telemetry/server.py`
**Changes Made:**
- Removed direct import: `from ..serve.cognitive_serve import CognitiveCoreClient`
- Replaced `CognitiveCoreClient` usage with HTTP client calls to separate service
- Added fallback logic for when cognitive service is unavailable
- Updated all cognitive endpoints to use HTTP communication

**Specific Changes:**
```python
# Before: Direct import and usage
from ..serve.cognitive_serve import CognitiveCoreClient
cognitive_client = CognitiveCoreClient()
result = await client.reason_about_failure(...)

# After: HTTP client with fallback
import httpx
cognitive_client = httpx.AsyncClient(base_url="http://sc_cognitive-serve:8000")
try:
    response = await client.post("/cognitive/reason-about-failure", json={...})
    result = response.json()
    return result
except Exception:
    # Fallback to direct cognitive core usage
    cognitive_core = get_cognitive_core()
    # ... direct usage
```

**Endpoints Updated:**
- `/dspy/reason-about-failure`
- `/dspy/plan-task`
- `/dspy/make-decision`
- `/dspy/solve-problem`
- `/dspy/synthesize-memory`
- `/dspy/assess-capabilities`

## Files Created

### 1. `docker/cognitive_serve_entrypoint.py`
**Purpose:** New entrypoint for cognitive services running independently
**Features:**
- FastAPI app with cognitive endpoints
- Ray Serve deployment configuration
- Proper error handling and fallbacks

### 2. `docker/Dockerfile.cognitive-serve`
**Purpose:** Dockerfile for building cognitive serve service image
**Features:**
- Based on Ray project image
- Includes all necessary dependencies
- Proper user permissions (ray user)
- Health checks
- Exposes port 8000

### 3. `docker/docker-compose.cognitive-serve.yml`
**Purpose:** Docker Compose configuration for cognitive serve service
**Features:**
- Service definition with proper dependencies
- Network configuration
- Resource limits (2GB memory, 2 CPUs)
- Health checks
- Volume mounts for development

### 4. `docker/README-separated-services.md`
**Purpose:** Comprehensive documentation for the new architecture
**Contents:**
- Service architecture overview
- Running instructions
- Communication patterns
- Benefits of separation
- Troubleshooting guide
- Migration instructions

### 5. `docker/test-separation.sh`
**Purpose:** Test script to verify service separation
**Features:**
- Service availability checks
- Import separation verification
- Communication testing
- Network configuration validation
- Colored output for easy reading

### 6. `docker/CHANGES-SEPARATION.md`
**Purpose:** This document - summary of all changes

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Tightly Coupled)
```
seedcore-api (port 8002)
├── Direct imports of serve modules
├── CognitiveCoreClient usage
├── Serve modules loaded in same process
└── Single container with all functionality
```

### After (Loosely Coupled)
```
seedcore-api (port 8002)          sc_cognitive-serve (port 8002)
├── No serve module imports       ├── Cognitive endpoints
├── HTTP client for cognitive     ├── Ray Serve deployment
├── Fallback to direct usage      ├── Independent scaling
└── Focused on core API          └── Focused on AI services

seedcore-serve (port 8001)
├── General ML services
├── Ray Serve deployments
└── Independent scaling
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Service Independence**: Each service can be started, stopped, and scaled independently
2. **Fault Isolation**: Failures in serve modules don't affect the main API
3. **Resource Management**: Better resource allocation and monitoring per service
4. **Development Flexibility**: Developers can work on services independently
5. **Deployment Flexibility**: Services can be deployed to different environments
6. **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain and update individual services
7. **Testing**: Services can be tested in isolation

## Migration Steps

1. **Stop existing services**: `docker-compose down`
2. **Build new images**: `docker-compose build`
3. **Start with new architecture**: 
   ```bash
   docker-compose --profile core --profile ray --profile api --profile cognitive-serve up -d
   ```
4. **Verify separation**: Run `docker/test-separation.sh`
5. **Test functionality**: Verify all endpoints work correctly

## Configuration Changes

### Environment Variables
- **Main API**: No changes needed
- **Cognitive Service**: Added Ray and Serve configuration
- **Network**: All services use `seedcore-network`

### Port Mapping
- **Main API**: 8002 (unchanged)
- **Cognitive Service**: 8002 (mapped from internal 8000)
- **General Serve**: 8001 (unchanged)

## Testing

The separation can be verified using:
```bash
# Run the test script
./docker/test-separation.sh

# Manual verification
curl http://localhost:8002/health  # Main API
curl http://localhost:8002/health  # Cognitive Service
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # General Serve
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Service Discovery**: Implement proper service discovery for dynamic environments
2. **Load Balancing**: Add load balancing for multiple cognitive service instances
3. **Circuit Breakers**: Implement circuit breakers for better fault tolerance
4. **Metrics**: Add comprehensive metrics collection across all services
5. **Monitoring**: Implement proper monitoring and alerting for each service

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the system can be rolled back by:
1. Stopping new services: `docker-compose --profile cognitive-serve down`
2. Reverting code changes in `server.py`
3. Restarting with old architecture: `docker-compose --profile api up -d`

## Notes

- The main API maintains backward compatibility through fallback mechanisms
- All existing functionality is preserved
- Performance impact should be minimal (HTTP calls vs direct imports)
- Network latency between services should be negligible in containerized environment
