```

### 3. Test the System

#### Basic Energy Operations
```bash
# Check current energy state
curl http://localhost:8000/energy/gradient

# Run a simulation step (legacy)
curl http://localhost:8000/run_simulation_step

# Run fast loop (new)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/actions/run_fast_loop

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/actions/reset
```

#### Control Loop Operations
```bash
# Run slow loop (energy-aware role evolution)
curl http://localhost:8000/run_slow_loop
# or

## Architecture Components

### Organ Registry
The system uses a centralized `OrganRegistry` for state management:
```python
# Initialize registry
registry = OrganRegistry()

# Create and register organs
organ = Organ(organ_id="cognitive_organ_1")
registry.add(organ)

# Access organs
organ = registry.get("cognitive_organ_1")
all_organs = registry.all()
```

### Energy Ledger
The system tracks five energy terms:
- **pair**: Pairwise interaction energy
- **hyper**: Complexity-precision tradeoff energy
- **entropy**: Choice availability and uncertainty energy
- **reg**: Regularization and model complexity energy
- **mem**: Memory usage and compression energy

### Control Loops

#### Fast Loop
- Real-time agent selection based on energy gradients
- Task execution and energy updates
- Runs on every simulation step

#### Slow Loop
- **Energy-aware**: Adjusts roles based on current energy state
  - High energy â†’ Increase Explorer (E) role
  - Low energy â†’ Increase Specialist (S) role
  - Moderate energy â†’ Increase Optimizer (O) role
- **Simple**: Strengthens dominant roles without energy context
- Configurable learning rate for adjustment speed
- **Flexible**: Works with both organ lists and agent lists

#### Memory Loop
- Adaptive compression control via dE/dCostVQ estimation
- Memory utilization optimization
- Compression knob adjustment based on memory efficiency

### Agent Roles
Each agent has three role types with probabilities:
- **E (Explorer)**: Seeks new solutions and opportunities
- **S (Specialist)**: Focuses on specific tasks and optimization
- **O (Optimizer)**: Balances exploration and exploitation

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
cd seedcore
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Test Coverage
- Energy ledger operations and calculations
- Control loop functionality (both organ and agent inputs)
- Role evolution and performance metrics
- Memory management and compression
- OrganRegistry integration
- Integration tests for all components

## Energy Calculation Examples

### Pair Energy
```python
# Pair energy increases with interaction weight and similarity
ledger.add_pair_delta(weight=2.0, similarity=1.5)  # Adds 3.0 to pair energy
```

### Hyper Energy
```python
# Hyper energy based on complexity vs precision tradeoff
ledger.add_hyper_delta(complexity=0.8, precision=0.3)  # Adds 0.5 to hyper energy
```

### Entropy Energy
```python
# Entropy energy increases with choice availability and uncertainty
ledger.add_entropy_delta(choice_count=5, uncertainty=0.6)  # Adds 0.3 to entropy energy
```

### Memory Energy
```python
# Memory energy based on usage vs compression
ledger.add_mem_delta(memory_usage=0.7, compression_ratio=0.4)  # Adds 0.3 to mem energy
```
