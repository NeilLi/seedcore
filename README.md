## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.10 (for local development)

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd seedcore
```

### 2. Start Services
```bash
cd docker
./start-cluster.sh
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Always use `./start-cluster.sh` instead of `docker compose up -d` to ensure proper service startup order and dependency management. Individual service restarts may fail due to Ray cluster state dependencies.

**Note**: The Docker Compose configuration has been optimized to eliminate PYTHONPATH warnings and ensure clean builds.

## Architecture Components

### Agent Personality System
Each agent has a personality vector that influences collaboration:

```python
# Agent with personality vector
agent = Agent(
    agent_id="agent_alpha",
    h=np.array([0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7])  # 8D personality
)

# Calculate similarity between agents
similarity = cosine_similarity(agent1.h, agent2.h)
```

### Pair Statistics Tracking
The system learns which agent pairs work best together:

```python
# Track collaboration success
pair_stats = PAIR_TRACKER.get_pair("agent1", "agent2")
pair_stats.update_weight(success=True, learning_rate=0.1)

# Get historical performance
stats = PAIR_TRACKER.get_all_stats()
# Returns: {"agent1-agent2": {"weight": 0.85, "success_rate": 0.75, ...}}
```

### Organ Registry
The system uses a centralized `OrganRegistry` for state management:
```python
# Initialize registry
registry = OrganRegistry()

# Create and register organs
organ = Organ(organ_id="cognitive_organ_1")
registry.add(organ)

# Access organs
organ = registry.get("cognitive_organ_1")
all_organs = registry.all()
```

### Energy Ledger
The system tracks five energy terms:
- **pair**: Pairwise interaction energy (now with realistic learning)
- **hyper**: Complexity-precision tradeoff energy
- **entropy**: Choice availability and uncertainty energy
- **reg**: Regularization and model complexity energy
- **mem**: Memory usage and compression energy

### Energy Model Foundation
The system implements intelligent energy-aware agent selection and optimization:

```python
# Energy-aware task execution
from src.seedcore.agents.tier0_manager import Tier0MemoryManager

tier0_manager = Tier0MemoryManager()
result = tier0_manager.execute_task_on_best_agent(task_data)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Unified Energy Function**: Five-term energy calculation (pair, entropy, reg, mem, hyper)
- **Energy Gradient Proxies**: Intelligent agent suitability scoring
- **Task-Role Mapping**: Automatic mapping of tasks to optimal agent roles
- **Ray Integration**: Distributed energy calculations across the cluster

**Energy Terms:**
- **Pair Energy**: Collaboration similarity between agents
- **Entropy Energy**: Role diversity maintenance
- **Regularization Energy**: State complexity control
- **Memory Energy**: Memory pressure and information loss
- **Hyper Energy**: Complex pattern tracking (future)

### Control Loops

#### Slow Loop
- **Energy-aware**: Adjusts roles based on current energy state
  - High energy ‚Üí Increase Explorer (E) role
  - Low energy ‚Üí Increase Specialist (S) role
  - Moderate energy ‚Üí Increase Optimizer (O) role
- **Simple**: Strengthens dominant roles without energy context
- Configurable learning rate for adjustment speed
- **Flexible**: Works with both organ lists and agent lists

#### Memory Loop
- **Comprehensive Tiered Memory System**: Implements working memory (Mw) and long-term memory (Mlt)
- **Dynamic Memory Utility**: Calculates agent mem_util based on actual memory interactions
- **CostVQ Calculation**: Trade-off between memory usage, reconstruction loss, and staleness
- **Adaptive Compression Control**: Gradient-based optimization of compression knob
- **Memory Activity Simulation**: Realistic write/read cycles with feedback loops

### Agent Roles
Each agent has three role types with probabilities:
- **E (Explorer)**: Seeks new solutions and opportunities
- **S (Specialist)**: Focuses on specific tasks and optimization
- **O (Optimizer)**: Balances exploration and exploitation

## Realistic Simulation Features

### Two-Agent Task Simulation
The new `/actions/run_two_agent_task` endpoint provides realistic collaboration:

1. **Random Agent Selection**: Picks two agents randomly
2. **Personality Compatibility**: Calculates cosine similarity between personality vectors
3. **Historical Learning**: Uses past collaboration success rates
4. **Capability Integration**: Combines agent capabilities with historical weights
5. **Energy Calculation**: Updates pair energy based on `-w_effective * similarity`
6. **Success Simulation**: Task success probability based on similarity
7. **Learning Update**: Updates pair statistics for future collaborations

### Example Task Response
```json
{
  "message": "Two-agent task completed between agent_alpha and agent_beta",
  "agents": {
    "agent1": {
      "id": "agent_alpha",
      "capability": 0.5,
      "personality": [0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7]
    },
    "agent2": {
      "id": "agent_beta", 
      "capability": 0.5,
      "personality": [0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]
    }
  },

    "cosine_similarity": 0.92,
    "historical_weight": 1.0,
    "effective_weight": 0.25,
    "energy_delta": -0.23
  },
  "task_result": {
    "successful": true,
    "success_probability": 0.92
  },
  "new_energy_state": {...},
  "pair_stats": {...}
}
```

## Comprehensive Memory System

### Tiered Memory Architecture
The system implements a sophisticated tiered memory structure as described in the energy validation document:

#### Memory Tiers
- **Mw (Working Memory)**: Fast, small-capacity memory for active processing
- **Mlt (Long-term Memory)**: Slower, large-capacity memory for persistent storage

#### Memory Operations
```python
# Write data to memory
success = MEMORY_SYSTEM.write(agent, "data_id", "Mw", data_size=10)

# Read data from memory (searches Mw first, then Mlt)
author_id = MEMORY_SYSTEM.read(reader_agent, "data_id")

# Log salient events
MEMORY_SYSTEM.log_salient_event(agent)
```

### Dynamic Memory Utility Calculation
Agent memory utility is now calculated based on actual memory interactions:

```python
# Calculate mem_util based on memory interactions
mem_util = calculate_dynamic_mem_util(agent, weights={
    'w_hit': 0.6,      # Weight for memory hits on writes
    'w_salience': 0.4   # Weight for salient events
})

# Formula: (w_hit * memory_hits_on_writes + w_salience * salient_events_logged) / memory_writes
```

### CostVQ Energy Calculation
The memory energy term is calculated using the CostVQ function:

```python
cost_vq_data = calculate_cost_vq(memory_system, compression_knob)

# Components:
# - bytes_used: Total memory usage across tiers
# - recon_loss: Information loss due to compression (1.0 - compression_knob)
# - staleness: Based on hit rate (1.0 / (1.0 + hit_rate))
# - cost_vq: Weighted sum of components
```

### Memory Loop Operation
The comprehensive memory loop performs these steps:

1. **Write Phase**: Randomly select agents to write data to memory tiers
2. **Read Phase**: Simulate agents reading data, creating feedback loops
3. **Utility Calculation**: Calculate dynamic mem_util for all agents
4. **Energy Update**: Calculate and update memory energy using CostVQ
5. **Compression Optimization**: Update compression knob using gradient descent
6. **Metrics Collection**: Gather comprehensive memory statistics

### Example Memory Loop Response
```json
{
  "message": "Comprehensive memory loop completed successfully!",
  "compression_knob": 0.65,
  "average_mem_util": 0.42,
  "individual_mem_utils": {
    "agent_alpha": 0.38,
    "agent_beta": 0.45,
    "agent_gamma": 0.43
  },
  "memory_metrics": {
    "average_mem_util": 0.42,
    "total_memory_writes": 15,
    "total_memory_hits": 8,
    "total_salient_events": 3
  },
  "cost_vq_breakdown": {
    "cost_vq": 0.23,
    "bytes_used": 150,
    "recon_loss": 0.35,
    "staleness": 0.12,
    "hit_rate": 0.53
  },
  "memory_energy": 0.23,
  "memory_system_stats": {
    "Mw": {"bytes_used": 50, "hit_count": 5, "data_count": 3},
    "Mlt": {"bytes_used": 100, "hit_count": 3, "data_count": 7}
  }
}
```

### Agent Memory Tracking
Each agent now tracks detailed memory interactions:

```python
agent = Agent(agent_id="test_agent")
# Memory interaction fields:
agent.memory_writes = 5          # Number of memory writes
agent.memory_hits_on_writes = 3  # Times this agent's data was read
agent.salient_events_logged = 2  # Number of salient events
agent.total_compression_gain = 0.0  # Compression benefits
agent.mem_util = 0.52           # Calculated memory utility
```

## Testing

```bash
cd seedcore
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Docker & Deployment Improvements (2024)

### Optimized Docker Image
- **Multi-stage Dockerfile**: Now uses a multi-stage build for smaller, more secure images.
- **Minimal requirements**: Production images use `requirements-minimal.txt` (excludes unused ML libraries like DGL).
- **.dockerignore**: Now excludes dev, data, and build artifacts for smaller build context.
- **Alpine variant**: Optional `Dockerfile.alpine` for ultra-small images (experimental).
- **Image size reduced**: From 1.7GB to 749MB for the API server.

### Usage

**Build optimized image:**
```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t seedcore-api:optimized .
```

**(Optional) Build Alpine image:**
```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.alpine -t seedcore-api:alpine .
```

**Run:**
```bash
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 seedcore-api:optimized
```

**For development:**  
- Use the standard image and `requirements.txt` for full-featured dev environment.
- Use volume mounts in `docker-compose.yml` for live code reload.

**For production:**  
- Use the optimized image and `requirements-minimal.txt` for fast, secure deployment.

### Image Analysis
A new script is provided to analyze image size and bloat:
```bash
bash docker/analyze-image.sh
```

### Development Workflow
- **Development:** Use the normal image for rapid iteration, debugging, and testing.
- **Release:** Use the optimized image for deployment to minimize size and attack surface.

### Other Notable Changes
- **Redis, Prometheus, asyncpg, Ray**: All dependencies are now managed for both dev and prod.
- **Improved error handling and logging** in the API server and memory consolidation logic.
- **Runtime tuning endpoints** and health checks added.
- **Docker Compose**: Now references the correct Dockerfile and context for builds.

### Quick Migration
- If you want to use the new optimized image in Compose, set:
  ```yaml
  image: seedcore-api:optimized
  ```
  Or keep the build section with the correct context and Dockerfile path.
