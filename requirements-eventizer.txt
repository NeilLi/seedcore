# The eventizer dependencies listed below have been synchronized into:
# - /pyproject.toml (main Python package dependencies)
# - /docker/requirements-minimal.txt (Docker container dependencies)
#
# ⚠️  DO NOT USE THIS FILE FOR INSTALLATION ⚠️
# Use the main requirement files instead to ensure consistency.
#
# This file is kept for documentation purposes and contains:
# - Core eventizer dependencies (now in main files)
# - Optional/experimental dependencies (commented out)
# - Fallback implementation notes
#
# =============================================================================

# Eventizer Dependencies (REFERENCE ONLY - Use pyproject.toml or docker/requirements-minimal.txt)
# Core dependencies
pydantic==2.5.0

# JSON Schema validation (recommended for pattern validation)
jsonschema>=4.0.0

# Aho-Corasick keyword matching (recommended for fast multi-pattern matching)
pyahocorasick>=2.0.0

# Microsoft Presidio for PII redaction (recommended for privacy)
presidio-analyzer>=2.2.0
presidio-anonymizer>=2.2.0

# =============================================================================
# OPTIONAL/EXPERIMENTAL DEPENDENCIES (Not in main requirement files)
# =============================================================================
# These are potential future enhancements that could be added to the main
# requirement files if needed. They are commented out to avoid conflicts.

# Pattern matching engines (optional)
# hyperscan>=0.7.0  # Multi-pattern matching - faster than regex for many patterns
# pyre2>=0.3.0      # RE2 regex engine - faster regex compilation and execution

# Text processing (optional)
# spacy>=3.0.0      # Advanced NLP - entity recognition, dependency parsing
# flashtext>=2.7    # Fast keyword matching - alternative to Aho-Corasick

# =============================================================================
# FALLBACK BEHAVIOR
# =============================================================================
# The eventizer will work with basic Python regex and string operations
# even without these optional dependencies, using fallback implementations.
# 
# Core functionality (pydantic, jsonschema, pyahocorasick, presidio) is
# now included in the main requirement files and should be installed.
