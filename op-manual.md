# SeedCore Application Operation Manual

This manual provides instructions for operating the `seedcore` application stack using the primary control script, `sc-cmd.sh`. This script is the main entry point for starting, stopping, and managing all the services.

-----

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The application stack is managed by Docker Compose and is composed of several key service groups, defined by profiles in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

* **Core Services (`--profile core`):** The foundational databases that store the application's data.
    * `postgres`: SQL database with pgvector for vector embeddings.
    * `mysql`: General-purpose SQL database.
    * `neo4j`: Graph database for relationship data.
* **Ray Cluster (`--profile ray`):** The distributed computing backbone for processing tasks.
    * `ray-head`: The master node that manages the Ray cluster, runs Ray Serve for model deployment, and hosts the Ray Dashboard.
    * `ray-worker`: Scalable worker nodes that execute distributed tasks. These are defined in `ray-workers.yml`.
* **API Service (`--profile api`):** The main application interface.
    * `seedcore-api`: A FastAPI application that serves the primary API, interacts with the databases, and submits jobs to the Ray cluster.
* **Observability Stack (`--profile obs`):** Tools for monitoring and logging.
    * `prometheus`: Collects metrics from the Ray cluster and other services.
    * `grafana`: Provides dashboards for visualizing metrics.
    * `node-exporter`: Exports system-level metrics from the host machine.

-----

## üöÄ Main Commands (`./sc-cmd.sh`)

All operations are performed using the `sc-cmd.sh` script. Below are the available commands.

### **Start Cluster (`up`)**

This command builds and starts the entire application stack, including the databases, Ray cluster, and API.

* **Usage:**
  ```bash
  ./sc-cmd.sh up [num_workers]
  ```
* **Description:**
    * Starts all services defined in `docker-compose.yml` (core, ray, api, and obs profiles).
    * Waits for the `ray-head` container to become fully operational and for the internal Ray Serve applications to be ready. This can take a few minutes.
    * Scales the `ray-worker` service to the specified number of replicas.
* **Arguments:**
    * `[num_workers]` (Optional): The number of `ray-worker` containers to start. **Defaults to 3.**

### **Stop Cluster (`down`)**

This command stops and removes all containers, networks, and volumes associated with the project.

* **Usage:**
  ```bash
  ./sc-cmd.sh down
  ```
* **Description:** This is a complete teardown. It will stop and delete all running services, including the databases.

### **Restart Application (`restart`)**

This command performs a "hot reload" of the application layer, restarting the Ray cluster and API while leaving the databases running.

* **Usage:**
  ```bash
  ./sc-cmd.sh restart
  ```
* **Description:** This is the preferred way to apply changes to the application code without losing database state.
  1.  Stops and removes the existing `ray-worker`s.
  2.  Restarts the application services: `ray-head`, `seedcore-api`, `prometheus`, `grafana`, and `node-exporter`.
  3.  Waits for `ray-head` to become healthy again.
  4.  Starts the same number of `ray-worker`s that were running before the restart.

### **Restart API Only (`restart-api`)**

This command performs a quick restart of only the `seedcore-api` service.

* **Usage:**
  ```bash
  ./sc-cmd.sh restart-api
  ```
* **Description:** Useful during development for quickly applying changes made only to the API code without restarting the entire Ray cluster.

### **Check Status (`status`)**

Displays the current status of all running containers in the stack.

* **Usage:**
  ```bash
  ./sc-cmd.sh status
  ```
* **Description:** It provides two sections: one for the main services (`docker-compose.yml`) and one for the `ray-worker`s (`ray-workers.yml`).

### **View Logs (`logs`)**

Tails the logs for specific services. You must specify which service group you want to see.

* **Usage:**
  ```bash
  ./sc-cmd.sh logs {head|api|workers}
  ```
* **Arguments:**
    * `head`: Shows logs for the `ray-head` container.
    * `api`: Shows logs for the `seedcore-api` container.
    * `workers`: Shows aggregated logs for all running `ray-worker` containers.
