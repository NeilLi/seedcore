# SeedCore Dynamic Specializations Configuration
# ==============================================
# Minimal baseline configuration for dynamic specializations.
# 
# NOTE: The primary source of truth for agent specializations is pkg_subtask_types
# in the database, managed by CapabilityMonitor. This file provides only a minimal
# baseline for static initialization. Dynamic specializations from the database
# will override any configurations defined here.

  # NOTE: reachy_actuator specialization is dynamically managed via pkg_subtask_types in the database.
  # Do NOT define it here in static YAML to avoid race conditions during startup.
  # The CapabilityMonitor will register it from the database and agents will spawn on-demand via JIT.
  # This ensures agents are created with the correct specialization from the start.
  #
  # If you need a baseline RoleProfile for reachy_actuator, it should be defined in pkg_subtask_types
  # default_params.executor and default_params.routing, not in this static YAML file.
